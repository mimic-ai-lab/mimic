## üéØ What is Mimic?

Mimic is an immersive testing arena where lifelike virtual personas interact with your chat-, web-socket-, and voice-based assistants exactly as real people would‚Äîonly faster, louder, and at limitless scale.

It's where product managers, conversational designers, and QA teams watch their assistants navigate everything from mundane small talk to once-in-a-lifetime emergencies, uncovering hidden flaws long before launch day.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **AI-Powered Agent Bootstrap**  
  Automatically generate realistic personas and evaluation metrics when creating new agents. Uses OpenAI to create platform-specific personas with detailed demographics, communication styles, and conversation patterns. Each agent gets custom evaluation criteria based on its purpose and platform.

- **Persona Swarms**  
  Instantly spin up hundreds‚Äîor thousands‚Äîof synthetic users, each with unique backstories, emotional tones, and conversation quirks. Mix and match demographics, languages, and typing styles (emoji-heavy, typo-prone, rapid-fire, etc.) to see how your assistant handles the glorious unpredictability of real human variety.

- **Voice Agents & IVR**  
  Run end-to-end phone calls with crystal-clear speech, silence detection, cross-talk, and interruptions. Test wake-word timing, DTMF menus, and caller patience thresholds‚Äîexposing awkward pauses, misrecognitions, and IVR dead ends before your customers do.

- **Time-Travel Scenarios**  
  Accelerate a user's life arc‚Äîsimulate months or years in minutes, replay events on demand, and verify your assistant adapts to long-term changes, remembers promises, and evolves with the user.

- **Stress & Spike Testing**  
  Ramp your test bed from calm Monday mornings to holiday-season chaos with a click. Adjustable think-time jitter, concurrency, and burst profiles let you confirm backend resilience and latency safeguards under real-world surges.

- **Edge-Case Discovery**  
  Inject garbled audio, code-switched language, sarcasm, or double-negatives. Persona "troublemakers" push your assistant off script to expose hidden loops and "that should never happen" moments‚Äîbecause they always do.

- **Insightful Dashboard**  
  Get live transcripts, heat maps of slow responses, and persona-by-persona success rates. Export every session for deeper analysis in your BI stack, transforming conversations into actionable data.

- **Plugin-Ready & Extensible**  
  Add new channels‚ÄîSlack, Telegram, SMS‚Äîvia drop-in adapters. Create custom persona generators or analytics panels in TypeScript. The community (or your team) can extend Mimic without waiting for core releases.

- **Fair-Code Freedom**  
  Source available, free for personal and internal company use. Transparent roadmap, welcoming PRs‚Äîbuild trust with stakeholders while protecting your commercial edge.

### üîÑ Temporal Workflow Architecture

Mimic uses **Temporal** for orchestrating long-running processes like agent bootstrap workflows:

- **Agent Bootstrap Workflow**: Automatically generates personas and evaluations when agents are created
- **Shared Workflows**: Reusable workflow definitions in `packages/temporal-workflows`
- **Activities**: Discrete units of work (OpenAI calls, database operations)
- **Temporal Cloud**: Managed Temporal service for production reliability

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+
- **Yarn** 4.9.1+
- **PostgreSQL** (for data persistence)
- **Temporal Cloud** (for workflow orchestration)
- **OpenAI API** (for persona and evaluation generation)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mimic-ai-lab/mimic.git
cd mimic

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development servers
yarn dev
```

This will start:

- **API** at http://localhost:4000
- **Dashboard** at http://localhost:3000
- **Worker** (background processing)

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mimic"
# üí° Suggested: Use [Neon](https://neon.tech) for PostgreSQL hosting

# Server Configuration
API_SERVER_PORT=4000
NODE_ENV=development
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Clerk Authentication
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_your-clerk-publishable-key"
CLERK_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_your-clerk-secret-key"
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_your-clerk-webhook-secret"
# üí° Get your keys from [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com)

# Temporal Cloud (for workflow orchestration)
TEMPORAL_API_KEY="your-temporal-cloud-api-key"
TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE="your-temporal-namespace"
TEMPORAL_ADDRESS="your-temporal-cloud-address"
# üí° Get your keys from [Temporal Cloud](https://cloud.temporal.io)

# OpenAI (for persona and evaluation generation)
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
# üí° Get your key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com)

# Optional: Sentry for error tracking
